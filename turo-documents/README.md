Calculator apps are really interesting. We built a calculator called Turo. It's awesome.

* [A desktop calculator](http://turo.io)
* [An Android calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.turo.app)

This project is for documenting the Turo language, and distributing `.turo` files.

The [`turo-docs` directory](turo-docs) contains the `.turo` files that are used at startup for each of the Turo apps above.

The [`examples` directory](example) contains some useful and fun examples.
