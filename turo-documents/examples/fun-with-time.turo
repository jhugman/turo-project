NANO_CENTURY = 1e-9 * 100 year in s

PI_SECONDS = pi s
(NANO_CENTURY / PI_SECONDS - 1) * 100
i.e. pi seconds is equal to a nano-century, to an accuracy of 0.4%

SQRT_10_SECONDS = (sqrt 10) s
(SQRT_10_SECONDS / NANO_CENTURY - 1) * 100
i.e. sqrt(10) seconds is equal to a nano-century, to an accuracy of 0.3%

unit megasecond : 1e6 s
1 year - 32 megasecond in year
i.e. a year is 32 mega-seconds to an accuracy of 1%
